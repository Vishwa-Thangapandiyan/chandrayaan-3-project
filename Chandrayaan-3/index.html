        <h2><b><u>About the Spacecraft:</u></b></h2>
        <image src="images/chandrayaan3-1.webp"></image>
        <p>Chandrayaan-3 is a follow-on mission to Chandrayaan-2 to demonstrate end-to-end capability in safe landing and roving on the lunar surface. It consists of Lander and Rover configuration. It will be launched by LVM3 from SDSC SHAR, Sriharikota. 
            Chandrayaan-3 consists of an indigenous Lander module (LM), Propulsion module (PM) and a Rover with an objective of developing and demonstrating new technologies required for Inter planetary missions. The Lander will have the capability to soft land at a specified lunar site and deploy the Rover which will carry out in-situ chemical analysis of the lunar surface during the course of its mobility. 
        </p>

        <h4>Lander Module-‘Vikram’ and Rover-‘Pragyan’</h4>
        <p>
            The LM was nicknamed ‘Vikram’, sanskrit for ‘valour’, and the Rover was named ‘Pragyan’, sanskrit for ‘wisdom’. The Chandrayaan-3 Vikram lander was an improved version of the Chandrayaan-2 Vikram lander, with more fuel and one less throttleable engine. The Pragyan Rover was a new iteration of the Rover onboard Chandrayaan-2; a six-wheeled solar-powered vehicle that deployed from the LM. Pragyan was capable of travelling up to 500 m at 1 cm per second. Differential steering controlled the Rover’s motion, with each wheel driven by independent brushless electric motors, cushioned by a rocker-bogie suspension system.</p>

            <b><u>1. Earth Centric Phase:</u></b> 
            Phase one of Chandrayaan-3’s mission consisted of pre-launch procedures, the launcher’s liftoff and ascent, and a series of Earth-bound manoeuvres to increase its orbit away from Earth.
            A little over 15 minutes later, at 09:21 UTC, Chandrayaan-3 separated from LVM3 after being placed in a parking orbit of approximately 550 km in altitude.

            <b><u>Lunar Transfer Phase:</u></b> 
            Phase two for Chandrayaan-3 involved the spacecraft leaving Earth’s orbit and starting a trajectory for the Moon, with a translunar injection (TLI). The TLI allowed the spacecraft to escape Earth’s gravitational pull through a number of precisely timed burns from the PM when at perigee (closest point to Earth in elliptical orbit).

            <b><u>Moon Centric Phase:</u></b> 
            The third phase of Chandrayaan-3 began with a Lunar-Orbit Insertion (LOI), during which the spacecraft transitioned from its translunar orbit as it was captured by the gravitational influence of the Moon. Several Moon-bound manoeuvres were required to decrease the eccentricity of the lunar orbit, which were the product of several retrograde (opposing direction of motion) burns performed at perilune (closest point to the Moon). 
            These manoeuvres have the opposite effect to the Earth-bound manoeuvres, as its orbit circularises from a decreased velocity.
            Phase three followed with PM and LM separation, followed by de-boosting and a pre-landing phase for the LM before it touched down on the lunar surface. Once landed, the LM and onboard Rover began their one lunar day normal phase in which they performed experiments on the surface.
